# Hangman
This is Go TUI [Hangman](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Hangman) game built with the lovely [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework.

This project exists to teach myself Go and learn about BubbleTea because it looks like an understandable, powerful, and good looking TUI framework. My past attempt at a [TUI in Python](https://github.com/braheezy/pyrdle) didn't go so well. It's already going much better with this project :)

## Usage
For now, clone the project and then run:
```console
go run .
```

Enjoy!
